Description: Contingency table analysis is performed based on maximum likelihood (ML) fitting of 
             multinomial-Poisson homogeneous (MPH) and homogeneous linear predictor (HLP) models. 
             See Lang (2004) <doi:10.1214/aos/1079120140> and Lang (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001042> 
             for MPH and HLP models. Objects computed include model goodness-of-fit statistics; likelihood-
             based (cell- and link-specific) residuals; and cell probability and expected count estimates along 
             with standard errors. This package can also compute test-inversion--e.g. Wald, profile likelihood, 
             score, power-divergence--confidence intervals for contingency table estimands, when table 
             probabilities are potentially subject to equality constraints. For test-inversion intervals, see 
             Lang (2008) <doi:10.1002/sim.3391> and Zhu (2020) <doi:10.17077/etd.005331>.
